Purpose: A "junk drawer" for helper files that aren't models, services, or screens.

What goes here:

constants.dart: A file to store your app's colors, font sizes, etc., so you can reuse them easily.

validators.dart: A file to store functions that check if an email is valid or a password is strong enough.
